# Adding a New Repo to Git and Linking it to a Repository (Repo)

# Make a new project directory (dir)
$ mkdir TheProject

# Enter the dir
$ cd TheProject  # Ensuring case consistency

# Initialize Git
$ git init

# Create a new README file
$ touch README

# Write to the README file
$ echo "This is the project to end all other projects" > README

# Stage the README file in Git
$ git add README

# Commit the staged files to your local repo
$ git commit -m "Initial commit with README"

# Link your local repo to a GitHub repository using your GitHub URL
$ git remote add origin <github-repo-link>

# Push your code to the master branch of your remote repo on GitHub
$ git push -u origin master  # -u sets the upstream

# Congratulations! You have set up Git in your repo.

# Carrying on, remember to stage your changes and commit to the repo before doing any more push requests.

# Note: Since we used -u when pushing, you can now simply use git push for subsequent pushes.
