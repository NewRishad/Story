# Git Basics
```bash
# getting started with a new repo
# make a new dir
$ mkdir AR_Modelling
# enter dir
$ cd AR_modelling
# initialize git
$ git init
# create a file in the repo
$ touch app.c
# make git take a snapshot of the file
$ git add app.c# 
# commit the file to git repo
$ git commit -m "Initial Commit"

# go to github and create a repo. 
# If you don't have a github account, make sure to log in using git config

# connect your local repo to the github repo that you created
$ git remote add origin <url-link-from-github>  # binds the master branch to origin
# push your code from your remote code in origin to the master branch
$ git push -u origin master  			# -u refers to upstream meaning that you can now just do $ git push
# Congradulations you have set up a basic git project that allows for endless code failure
```
