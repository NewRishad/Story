# Story: My Git Adventures
-----
Welcome to my Git notebook, where I document the twists and turns of my journey with Git. This repository isn't a formal teaching tool; it's my personal playground, filled with notes and experiences as I navigate through version control. The journey follows the Pro Git book as the main reference.
